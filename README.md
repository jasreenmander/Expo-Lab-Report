## Abstract
The history of coffee in Brazil, one of the major producers of the beverage, is outlined in this study. The economic and social impact of coffee trade and growing on Brazil during colonial control is explored. Using a data set pertaining to the different plantations present from the early 1800s and early 1900s we can explore the history of Brazil using StoryMaps by mapping these plantations. Then through further research and data present in the dataset the impact these plantations had on the surrounding areas economically and socially can be better understood due to the intersectionality of information and media it provides users.  

## Introduction
The history of coffee in Brazil is a rich and fascinating subject, and this study aims to delve deeper into its economic and social impact during the first days of colonial control. The coffee trade rapidly became one of the country's main exports and played a vital role in shaping Brazil's economy and society during this period. To better understand the impact of coffee on Brazil, this study utilizes a data set that contains information on different plantations present from the early 1800s to the early 1900s. By mapping these plantations using StoryMaps, we can explore the spatial relationship between different plantations and the surrounding areas. This approach allows us to better understand how the coffee industry shaped Brazil socially and provided a foundation for its economic growth. Moreover, StoryMaps provide a platform for deeper research into the impact of these plantations on the surrounding areas economically and socially. The intersectionality of information and media provided by StoryMaps can help us understand the complex relationships between different plantations, labor practices, and their effects on the economy and society. This study demonstrates how the use of StoryMaps can enrich our understanding of Brazil's coffee history by mapping and contextualizing different historical events and locations. Using the temporal relation which within a temporal position includes rearranging events in accordance with a revised location and graphical expressions designed to accommodate various points of view (Drucker 2011)[3](#3), and by combining data sets and multimedia content, StoryMaps provide an interactive and engaging platform to explore the history of coffee in Brazil, and its impact on the country's economy, society, and culture.

## Methods
For this study it was important to first gather information relevant to the history of Brazil’s coffee industry particularly focused on the earlier history of it. To gather this information, it was key to search for legitimate websites containing historical data, the data used for this study was found on Harvard Data verse. The data is divided into four categories, three of which are based on the geographical areas of these coffee places, these categories according to the geography were “São Paulo Places," "Rio de Janeiro Places," and "Other State Locations". The fourth category “Railroad Places” is about the coffee places in the different regions that were associated with the expansion of the railroad in Brazil. Variables present within these categories were place, state which referred to the geographical location of these place and other variables the data presents were the time frame of this data, which spans from roughly 1830 to 1930, and how many years these places were open for. The last two variable used for this study was description and notes which highlighted what these places did and other information about them, the notes variable was used for only select places. After viewing the data and the different categories, an analysis of this information was done by reading through the data and highlighting the places that had more of an impact than others, narrowing the data made it easier to focus on relevant data and variables that will provide more useful insights on the topic this study is exploring. After highlighting the data relevant to this study, the next step was to sort out into a excel spreadsheet that essentially used the same variables present in the data, but was a shortened version of it, so it was easier to interpret the data and form connections between the data and other sources used in the study.

Once the data was organized into a table, StoryMaps was explored and research about the digital tool was conducted, for this it was important that focus be on the purpose of the tool and what it offers its users in terms of effectiveness in developing a deeper understanding of the topic. For this, notes about the tool’s features, GIS, and usability were made and from there a connection between the data and StoryMaps was made, and lastly to understand how digital can be used to further our understanding, select readings were used.  


## Result
This study examined the history of coffee in Brazil and the effects it has on the local economy and social structure. Data analysis revealed that Sao Paulo's coffee shops were primarily in coffee-producing regions/counties and plantations, all of which contributed significantly to the boom of the industry after World War One. Factors such as labour costs, wages, and farmer rights, political violence, immigration, and transportation, such as the expansion of the railway, also contributed to the boom. Rio coffee places were like those in Sao Paulo, with Imbetiba port located in Macae, a plantation in the Central Plateau of the State of Rio de Janeiro, and the immigrant colony of Nova Friburgo established in 1847. Itepurana was integrated into the state's economy, and Tres Rios was a coffee-growing region. Finally, Barau was a small settlement in the backlands. Rio de Janeiro was a significant region during the early stages of the economic development of coffee, while other states such as Governador Valadares and Uberaba helped in expanding plantations. Sao Paulo had more of an impact due to labour protests and rights, political violence, and immigration destinations. Exploration and research of StoryMaps revealed that ArcGIS StoryMaps allows for users to visually narrate a story in a interactive manner by combining maps, text, images and multimedia (ArcGis StoryMaps, n.d)[2](#2).  This tool uses a geographic information system (GIS), which essentially creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data (ArcGis StoryMaps, n.d)[2](#2). GIS can connect and combine all descriptive and location data to and within a map, GIS aids users in comprehending trends, connections, and spatial context as it offers a basis for mapping and analysis, which are applied in science and practically every sector of the economy (ArcGis StoryMaps, n.d)[2](#2). The features that ArcGIS StoryMaps offer users in term of creating their custom maps and their narrative are listed below along with  a description of each feature. 

 1. Express Maps    -   Allows users to create customs interactive maps through which users can plot points and other key information that can be used to gain a spatial understanding of the relationship between the information (ArcGis StoryMaps, n.d)[1](#1)

 2. Builder -   Similar to blocks in the tool Notion, StoryMaps also follows a similar format in which there is a built in option that allows you to build upon your information through incorporating media such as images, audio, video, etc (ArcGis StoryMaps, n.d)[1](#1)

 3. Themes  -   Allows for users to quickly style each elements more efficiently and allows users to pick design themes more fitting for their narrative (ArcGis StoryMaps, n.d)[1](#1)

## Discussion 
As stated above, StoryMaps offers a feature that follows a geographical information system called Express Maps that allows for custom interactive maps to be created so users are able to visualize their data more clearly, this features in particular can be highly useful in creating a better understanding of our data because it allows for us to easily plot the different coffee places within different regions and by doing so we are able to visually see what we already know about the data in terms of how and why they impact the surrounding areas. We also are able to identify trends and relationship between each element of the story.  By visually plotting this information an individual can spot those connection and trends more quickly, rather than sitting there and having to read through it. Since this data spans over different years and shows different changes it is important to consider temporality, which defines how time on its own is a factor that can easily by changed by any variable or occurrences (Drucker 2011)[3](#3), StoryMaps allows for data to be interpreted using a temporal model of their own as users are able to show those changes and what causes those changes through semantics inflections and syntactic inflections, syntactic inflections mark the effects points, and create relational markings, and semantic inflections are given to their characteristics independently, as things (Drucker 2011)[3](#3). In relation to this study, we are now able to make a connection between the data and StoryMaps, through StoryMaps we can weave together a story using our data by embedding information within one another so there’s is more layers to the story that can be easily visualized and the timeline from early 1800s and early 1900s can be easily described. Semantics inflections would be considered the regions themselves as well at the different coffee places, these are incorporated with syntactic inflections which can be different elements such as different types of media that can be embedded through StoryMaps, as well as legends that can indicate relational markings for key events in the history of the individual places, such as the 1920s political violence, labor costs and rights, and railway expansion. By seeing these inflections a user can visualize the data more easily and form a more clear understanding of the different trends and patterns and the economic and social impact of these places.
